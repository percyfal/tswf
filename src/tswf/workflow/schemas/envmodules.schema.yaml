  Envmodules configuration file consisting of key:list mappings. Each
  entry consists of a list of module names as defined at an HPC. Note
  that module names will differ between HPCs and that the envmodules
  file therefore most likely is not portable to other systems. For
  this, define and/or rely on the conda environments defined in the
  workflows.

  Environment modules are accessed in snakemake rules via the
  configuration section config["envmodules"]. The key names are reused
  across different rules and therefore don't necessarily map to rule
  names.

  The example below shows module settings as defined at the UPPMAX HPC
  (https://www.uppmax.uu.se/).
